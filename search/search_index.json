The FAIR data principles were published in 2016 ; FAIR stands for - F for Findable, A for Accessible, I for interoperable, R for Reusable. The FAIR Data Principles make data more valuable as it is easier to find through unique identifiers and easier to combine and integrate thanks to the formal shared knowledge representation. It\u2019s important to note that the FAIR Data Principles were created to be understood/applied not only by humans but also by machines, in an automated way.</p> <p>More broadly, the FAIR principles describe how research outputs should be organised so they can be more easily accessed, understood, exchanged and reused. The FAIR principles describe a continuum of increasing reusability. How can we translate the FAIR principles to training materials? Preparing training materials is time-consuming and challenging for both new and experienced trainers. Reusing existing materials is a possible solution but it requires that materials have been shared, properly described, and made available (i.e licenced) for reuse by their authors. </p> <p>The bioinformatics training community set out to address these challenges by adapting the FAIR Data Principles to training materials.

One approach to solving this issue is by finding and (re)using already existent materials. However, it requires that the authors of these have shared, properly described, and made these available for (re)use. It can be difficult to locate online resources that are appropriate for your teaching goals and that don\u2019t have licence or copyright constraints. They frequently lack the necessary metadata to permit their (re)use, are dispersed across numerous repositories, or are compartmentalised within their original institutions.</p> <p>The FAIR data principles, which stand for findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable, were released in 2016 . The purpose of the FAIR Data Principles is to increase the value of data by making it simpler to find through the use of unique identifiers and simpler to combine and integrate through the use of formal shared knowledge representation.

Well, a simple definition of training material is anything you would produce yourself (or reuse) as support for your teaching activity. These can be slides, datasets, videos, software, a GitHub repo, a collection of exercises, VMs/Containers, etc. In summary, any digital object which can be used to deliver a lesson, course or curriculum. In Chapter 2, we further describe types of materials and their levels of FAIRness as well. </p> <p>In 2018, a community of educators, trainers and training facilitators formed the ELIXIR FAIR Training focus group, which started the exercise of reflecting on what would be needed (what would it take) to make training FAIR and thus training materials FAIR. The result of this community exercise was published in the PLoS Computational Biology Ten Simple Rules collection with the paper 10 Simple Rules for Making Training Materials Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) <sup>1</sup>. which is summarised in Figure 1. Overall, the rules were defined to help instructors and training facilitators make their first steps into making training materials FAIR, enabling others to find, (re)use, and adapt them. Much water has flowed under the bridge since then, and many people have tried to FAIRify (at least partially) their materials, and we still see and feel that it\u2019s not so simple to do all the steps at once.</p> <p>But if this is not so simple, why should we care to make training materials FAIR? The main reason behind it is to share. The more we share training materials, the more we spread our knowledge with trainers, and by sharing, we are giving back to the community in a virtuous circle. Going beyond this magnanimous idea, we can improve our course content based on the feedback we receive from peers and learners, and we can also learn from them and progress. By sharing, we provide inspiration for other trainers on how to run an exercise or how we explain a concept in our lectures, in the same way that we get inspiration from others, from books or websites. </p> <p>Figure 1: Ten simple rules for making training materials FAIR. Reproduced under CC-BY-SA 4.0 from Garcia et al<sup>1</sup>.</p> <p>Today, sharing training materials is not an issue anymore because a vast data ecosystem is available. However, training materials are very diverse and less integrated, which makes it harder for both computers and human beings to find them, and for humans to reuse them. Today, a quick web search can help us find videos (on YouTube), presentations (in Zenodo or FigShare), and whole course materials (on GitHub, in decentralised institutional websites, or open globally-scoped repositories). Given that these repositories accept a wide range of data types in a wide range of formats and impose minimal limits (or criteria) on the descriptors of the data deposition, it can be difficult to determine the context in which the content was created or used (for which course, which audience), and thus being able to reuse it.</p> <p>Consider the following example in the domain of single-cell omics training to obtain an idea of the obstacles faced. A search in TeSS (the ELIXIR\u2019s Training portal) material session using the expression \u201csingle-cell\u201d will generate a list of a minimum of ten items - they are thus Findable. The difficulty is to know which ones can be used and in which context. They are therefore Findable but may not be Accessible or Accessible under a restrictive licence which would not allow you to Reuse them in your teaching context. And if they are Accessible, they may be in a format that requires specific software that requires a paid licence as well, for instance, an exercise in Matlab, which makes Interoperability more difficult or impossible if you don\u2019t have that licence. </p> <p>Findable, Accessible, and Reusable are three principles that one can intuitively and easily visualise their application for training materials. Interoperability is a little less but becomes less mysterious when we reflect on training material formats, and the interoperations trainers or learners can do to reuse them. We must note however that the FAIR principles were depicted to be followed/applicable by humans and machines. Even though it\u2019s difficult to imagine a machine reusing your training materials to teach, we need the machines to facilitate and interface F, A, I and R. The following paragraph, copied/pasted from the FAIR principles , can further shed some light on our reflections:</p> <p>Humans and machines often face distinct barriers when attempting to find and process data on the Web. Humans have an intuitive sense of \u2018semantics\u2019 (the meaning or intent of a digital object) because we are capable of identifying and interpreting a wide variety of contextual cues, whether those take the form of structural/visual/iconic cues in the layout of a Web page, or the content of narrative notes. As such, we are less likely to make errors in the selection of appropriate data or other digital objects, although humans will face similar difficulties if sufficient contextual metadata is lacking. The primary limitation of humans, however, is that we are unable to operate at the scope, scale, and speed necessitated by the scale of contemporary scientific data and complexity of e-Science. It is for this reason that humans increasingly rely on computational agents to undertake discovery and integration tasks on their behalf. This necessitates machines to be capable of autonomously and appropriately acting when faced with the wide range of types, formats, and access-mechanisms/protocols that will be encountered during their self-guided exploration of the global data ecosystem. It also necessitates that the machines keep an exquisite record of provenance such that the data they are collecting can be accurately and adequately cited. Assisting these agents, therefore, is a critical consideration for all participants in the data management and stewardship process\u2014from researchers and data producers to data repository hosts.</p> <p>Exercise</p> <p>Reflect on the FAIR principles and with your own words and examples, explain what are the FAIR principles and how they can be applied to your training materials. </p> <p>Exercise</p> <p>Reflect on your training materials or those that you have used at school as a child.

Open Science started as a movement aiming to make scientific research \u2013 in the broadest sense, i.e. including publications, data, software, and educational resources \u2013 openly accessible to the public. Other related terms are Open Access and Open Data. Open Access is the term that relates to publications. It aims to give researchers, students, and the interested public free and immediate access to scholarly publications. </p> <p>Open Data aims to encourage sharing data and code on repositories to make research results transparent and reproducible. However, paraphrasing the GO-FAIR consortium: FAIR does not necessarily mean OPEN. The FAIR principles enable something to be as open as possible and as closed as necessary. The level of openness defined in a data access licence affects the accessibility (A) of the data but not F, I, or R. </p> <p>The following is an interesting explanation from the GO-FAIR consortium that will help you understand why FAIR is not equal to Open:</p> <p>The \u2018A\u2019 in FAIR stands for \u2018Accessible under well defined conditions\u2019. There may be legitimate reasons to shield data and services generated with public funding from public access. These include personal privacy, national security, and competitiveness. The FAIR principles, although inspired by Open Science, explicitly and deliberately do not address moral and ethical issues pertaining to the openness of data. In the envisioned Internet of FAIR Data and Services, the degree to which any piece of data is available, or even advertised as being available (via its metadata) is entirely at the discretion of the data owner. FAIR only speaks to the need to describe a process \u2013 mechanised or manual \u2013 for accessing discovered data; a requirement to openly and richly describe the context within which those data were generated, to enable evaluation of its utility; to explicitly define the conditions under which they may be reused; and to provide clear instructions on how they should be cited when reused [11]. None of these principles necessitate data being \u201copen\u201d or \u201cfree\u201d. They do, however, require clarity and transparency around the conditions governing access and reuse. As such, while FAIR data does not need to be open, in order to comply with the condition of reusability, FAIR data are required to have a clear, preferably machine readable, license. The transparent but controlled accessibility of data and services, as opposed to the ambiguous blanket-concept of \u201copen\u201d, allows the participation of a broad range of sectors \u2013 public and private \u2013 as well as genuine equal partnership with stakeholders in all societies around the world.</p> <p>To contextualise the GO-FAIR consortium paragraph above, you can imagine that several universities, institutions, companies or countries worldwide still have institutional or national regulations that stipulate that in-house products should remain within their walls and are only accessible internally. In this case, training materials produced by their professors and instructors\u2019 employees should remain their property, and only internal access would be granted to their students, learners, and citizens. These materials are thus not Open, but they can still be FAIRifyed to benefit these internal users and your reusability as a trainer. By FAIRifying training materials, we are also documenting how and when they were used, which can be handy to refresh our minds later when we teach the same content again and as a good practice in data management as well. </p> <p>Exercise</p> <p>Write down the main difference between Open and FAIR. </p>","tags":["FAIR","Open","Findability","Accessibility","Interoperability","Reusability","Reproducibility","Training","Training materials","Types of training materials","Regulations"]},{"location":"chapters/chapter_01/#evaluate-yourself","title":"Evaluate yourself","text":"<p>Now that you have completed the chapter, you should have reached the learning outcomes.

Still, in this section, we will provide a definition of interoperability for training materials, and we will explain how this concept is related to the idea of reusability. Regarding reusability, it is essential to make a distinction between:</p> <ol> <li>Reusing parts of material by repurposing it for a new context or integrating it into another set of materials</li> <li>Reusing the material exactly as it is</li> </ol> <p>File formats will have different implications in the context of FAIRness depending on the two types of material reuse. Some formats facilitate FAIRness while others don\u2019t. To understand which formats facilitate interoperability and reusability, we must first understand these two concepts in the context of training and training materials. </p> <p>Exercise</p> <p>Read Rule 6 from the 10 simple rules paper, which is mainly about interoperability 10 simple rules paper.</p> <p>The key point of Rule 6 is: \u201cTraining materials need to be captured in interoperable formats, so that they can be used in different contexts (e.g., operating systems and software) and built upon later. For materials like slides, it is important that other trainers are able to (re)use, fine-tune or even extend them. This means that you should choose a format that supports editing and extension. </p> <p>Put in simple terms, training material is interoperable when we are able to take parts of it, like slides, exercises, images, etc., and incorporate them in other course material or export it in a different context, as well as fix errors or extend it. This is doable to different extent depending on the material format. Taking parts of a video or modifying a pdf is not impossible, but often requires a licence for the appropriate software or skills not easy to own. Using, e.g., text or markdown files will facilitate the updates of materials or their integration into a new context or a different set of materials. Interoperable formats, according to this definition, facilitate the reuse of materials as described in point 1 above. </p> <p>Does interoperability always implies reusability? Does a format that supports material editing and extension guarantee that the material can be easily reused? In principle yes, but it is not always the case. </p> <p>Exercise</p> <p>Have a look at the slides on the String Database (by Lars Juhl Jensen) on Slideshare.

Unless you had a licence allowing you to modify pdf files, the only way to reuse the presentation would be to reuse it exactly as it is. </p> <p>Exercise</p> <p>Consider the list in table 2.

Would it be straightforward to reuse the String Database presentation as stand-alone material? Each slide contains a single word or a short sentence. For example, here  is the content of the first 10 slides:</p> <ol> <li>Introduction to STRING Lars Juhl Jensen EMBL Heidelberg</li> <li>STRING</li> <li>integrate diverse evidence</li> <li>functional interactions</li> <li>hundreds of proteomes</li> <li>Ensembl</li> <li>SWISS-PROT</li> <li>prokaryotes</li> <li>genomic context methods</li> </ol> <p>How do you imagine a trainer teaching over these slides? What narrative would you use if you were to teach it? How could you find it out? Going further, these slides can be in Zenodo, have a DOI, have metadata describing it, be linked to TeSS, and still, you would not be able to teach if you don\u2019t have at least some indication of what you should say because the slides do not have some narrative. Thus there are two orders of problems: one is related to the format (see previous session), the other to the content and/or additional information provided with the material and explaining its purpose, how the material should be used (for self-learning, in classroom teaching) and delivered (mode of delivery). Interoperable formats are often reusable (e.g., pptx, markdown), but the reverse is only sometimes true. Some formats allow reuse of material while not being interoperable. In these cases, the material can only be reused as is and cannot be easily modified. Examples are pdf, png, jpeg, etc. formats. </p> <p>When training material is provided in reusable but not interoperable format, which means it should be used as is, it is particularly important that it is accompanied by some documentation explaining how the material is to be used, including - when appropriate - an extensive narrative describing word-by-word the meaning and purpose of each, e.g.,  slide or exercise.</p> <p>There are a few effective ways to do this:</p> <ol> <li>For a lecture-style presentation, you can annotate each slide with an extensive narrative capturing all aspects of the subject on the slides. You can put the complete transcript of the verbal presentation in the Notes panel in Powerpoint or in Google slides. Suppose you want to share your slides in pdf format. In that case, it is handier to place the detailed content into a handbook or use text-book style reference materials and keep the slides for lectures cleaner, only placing relevant elements directly on the slides. </li> <li>You may associate \u201cInstructor notes\u201d with the materials, but you don\u2019t need to include them in the materials. The Instructor notes should provide information drawing on your experience or the experience of other instructors. They may consist of technical tips and tricks, common problems, and a description of what parts or exercises are essential and what could be skipped in case of lack of time. Very good examples of Instructor/Trainer notes are provided by the Carpentries (Carpentry Trainer notes, Instructor notes template).</li> <li>You may create a lesson plan describing the purpose and the mode of delivery of each piece of material. Lesson plans could contain many practical details, including - for each part of the material - the time needed for the delivery, the learning experiences and expected learning outcomes.

This might be a collaborative process, involving several lesson developers or a main developer and some contributors providing feedback. If you are developing your materials in collaboration, using an online platform in this phase may provide the essential advantage of allowing real-time collaboration (although not all the online platforms do), but there are other advantages linked to using an online platform, such as: the possibility to develop materials from anywhere at any time (for example, if your working laptop is not available), use the online resource as a backup strategy, the possibility to take advantage of the online resource feature to move the training materials to the following stages.</p> <p>Phase 2 - Delivery</p> <p>Delivery is the phase when, after developing your materials, you will run the course (with an actual audience). If you have training materials in the format of slide decks, this is the phase where you present them. If you have videos or written materials, this is the phase when learners consult them. Consider that: (1) this may happen at a specific time and with a specific schedule (during a few days course) or as self-paced learning. (2) This may require interactions with you as a trainer or between participants, or none, depending on the type of activities that you included in the course design. (3) The materials hosting platform may include built-in assessment of learning, or not (e.g. short multiple choice tests to allow progression to the next chapter). All these features must be taken into account while choosing the platform to support the training delivery. Whatever the format and the activities are, you should in parallel design a way to capture the learners\u2019 feedback about the materials (another feature which may or may not be built-in to the platform used in delivery). Feedback will be essential in this phase to understand the level of maturity of the materials and enhance them. To allow changes to be made according to the received feedback, the platform you used in phase 1 should still be available to you. </p> <p>Phase 3 - Sharing</p> <p>Depending on the type of content, some learners might benefit from accessing the materials even after the course ends, to consolidate their knowledge, to access optional information that you didn\u2019t cover during the delivery, to (re)run some learning experiences, etc. The sharing phase is when you allow them to access the training materials asynchronously with the delivery phase: it might happen or not, but it should always happen in a FAIR process. We encourage you to consider the potential benefits of sharing the materials even before the delivery (e.g. to support some types of learners with impairments), but an extended discussion about this is beyond the current chapter\u2019s scope. Similarly, we encourage you to consider sharing your materials with other audiences, e.g. potential contributors, other trainers, experts. Once they will get to know about your training materials (phase 3), you can allow them to access the platform where you design them (phase 1), which may or may not be the same, and contribute to them.  </p> <p>Phase 4 - Archiving</p> <p>As phase 3, archiving might not always happen. This is the case when you are not actively delivering a course anymore, or for various reasons you are not actively sharing the materials with learners and/or contributors (e.g. they are outdated), but you still want to keep an history of them and to support acknowledgment of who authored them in the past. In this phase, you should not need to be able to edit them, and you would rather \u201cfreeze\u201d a specific version to be stored with extensive metadata about its contributors, when and where the course was delivered, and other information potentially useful for the trainers much more than for the learners. </p> <p></p> <p>Figure 3.1 A schematic representation of the training materials life cycle.

Sharing and archiving instead is a long term strategy.</p> <p>When thinking about the long-term implications, in particular for the phases of development, delivery and sharing, consider the lifetime of the trainign content. The time frame can vary from some months to some years (2, 5, 10 years from now, or forever for the posterity). Some topics may live well for a long time. For instance, a course on UNIX will live well for many months and years, because the \u201clanguage\u201d does not vary frequently over time, and 10 years can still be a reasonable long-term goal. Besides when archiving, you probably will not be particularly interested in enhancing FAIRness of outdated materials.</p> <p>When you sign a contract or pay for the usage of a platform, the validity and duration of the service is usually explicited in the contract itself, so you will be able to evaluate if that fits your aims. If instead you choose a free platform, you will need to dig more for this type of information. Zenodo, for example, has a long term commitment towards funders, so the platform commits to a specific time range. Other tools don\u2019t provide the same type of commitment, and tools that have a free version but also a business behind might have some features only available under payment (in some cases, only after some time). Open source and free platforms are those that are more likely to ensure a stricht commitments, but we suggest you consider that when a large community of users is behind those tools, the community ensure its continuity. In addition, you will probably have people to contact for guidance in using the platform and request features to. </p>","tags":["Training Development platform","Archiving","Collaborative development","Repository","Version control","Content management","Technological platform"]},{"location":"chapters/chapter_03/#advantages-and-disadvantages-of-the-platforms-in-each-of-the-four-phases","title":"Advantages and disadvantages of the platforms in each of the four phases","text":"<p>As anticipated in Figure 3.1, in different phases you might need to prioritise the needs of different types of audiences, and choose your platform accordingly. This should really be a case-by-case analysis and we don\u2019t aim at covering all the possible needs in this analysis, but we will summarise in the following paragraph the most common features to take into account in choosing a platform for each of the different phases. We will treat each phase separately, but we acknowledge that you might want to prioritise some more than others to minimise the number of platforms used in the entire process. </p> <p>In Phase 1, Design:</p> <ul> <li>You probably want to choose a platform that facilitates collaborative editing of the training materials from multiple collaborators. Even if you start working as the sole author of your materials, consider that your community of authors will only grow if you design a structure that will facilitate contributions (this concept is extensively covered in other chapters of this handbook). In addition, you could look at yourself as a possible second contributor in the future: the more information you provide to guide your collaborators, the more information you will have when you get back to your project when months (or years) have passed  since the last time you edited the materials. </li> <li>Consider this \u201cinformation\u201d (contribution guides, metadata about the materials, etc.) should be attached to the materials, easily reachable from them, but in principle it will not be included in the materials themselves (e.g. it\u2019s not part of the slide deck content). For this reason, another important feature to consider is how clearly does the platform you choose create a link between your guide for trainers, or your metadata, and the actual training materials (Chapter 5 includes a more detailed analysis of this). </li> <li>Finally, consider how easily the platform allows you to organise the training materials in modules. An extended discussion on modularisation of training (materials) goes beyond the scope of this chapter, however we would like to highlight that it will improve several aspects of FAIR. </li> </ul> <p>In Phase 2, Delivery:</p> <ul> <li>We would argue that during the course delivery you, together with all the trainers, are the main user of the training materials. When considering the platform to use during the delivery, prioritise the format and tools that simplify and support better the trainers. This will in turn ensure the best possible delivery quality. </li> <li>Examples of questions to be asked in this regard are: are the trainees viewing the same information than the trainer does? E.g. do trainers need to visualise notes on the side? If so, how will the platform allow that? You probably want to minimise the channels splitting the attention of both the trainees and the trainers, providing them all the necessary information but not more. </li> <li>Another set of questions can be: how easy should it be for trainers and trainees to live edit training materials during the course? Where and how will they follow practical activities? Do they need collaborative documents for that? And how and how long will they need to access the documents then?</li> <li>In this phase, keep accessibility and inclusivity in mind: e.g. will any of your learners be facilitated if you provide trascripts during an online lesson? </li> </ul> <p>In Phase 3, Sharing:</p> <ul> <li>Sharing will allow you to strengthen your training community, both in terms of increasing the number of trainers, facilitate their collaboration and reaching more trainees. In this phase, findability is to be prioritised, to ensure to be visible to a diversity of stakeholders. </li> <li>Examples of questions to be asked in this context are: what is the platform to which your stakeholder audiences already have access, or the skills to navigate and search in it? Does the platform allow searching in the first place?</li> <li>Or additionally, will you allow download of the training materials and will learners be able to share them with peers independently? Would you allow that, or would you prefer all trainees to access them through the same platform, also for usage mapping?</li> <li>Finally, is there any additional information that learners need to access together with the materials? How will the platform you use support the link between multiple types of information sources, if that\u2019s the case (e.g. videos of your lessons and slides)? </li> <li>A similar question for other potential trainers: do they need to access a trainers guide? How will you ensure that they are provided it, and if you plan to provide two different \u201ctrainers\u201d and \u201clearners\u201d guides, how do you plan to guide them to the right document?</li> </ul> <p>In Phase 4, Archiving:</p> <ul> <li>In this phase (if it happens), what you probably want is to secure an history of your training materials in a safe place, from where eventually others can access them. You are not aiming at enlarging the community of people that access them at this point, but consider that ensuring access from different institutitutions, for example, can become useful for you if you change your job position. Once again, everything you do to allow access to others can be useful to you in the future.</li> <li>Finally, consider that ensuring an archive of all your training materials creates demonstrators for your career development and your job applications, and your role as expert trainer in all other professional contexts. </li> </ul>","tags":["Training Development platform","Archiving","Collaborative development","Repository","Version control","Content management","Technological platform"]},{"location":"chapters/chapter_03/#the-life-cycle-of-training-materials-and-the-fair-principles","title":"The life-cycle of training materials and the FAIR principles","text":"<p>Recap of the four phases: - Materials development (collaborative or not), - Consultation of the training materials by your learners during the course delivery, - Sharing the training materials with learners and potential trainers after completion, - Archiving the training materials to provide long-term reference.</p> <p>Take into consideration that most of these platforms are not specifically designed for training materials. The platforms shown are differently fit for the different phases, e.g. the Google Suite allows easy collaborative development but, because it is not possible to search for projects that our account is not linked to, it strongly limits the possibilities of sharing.  Moreover, the platforms might support in different ways the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) application to training materials, e.g. Zenodo supports findability of materials through rich metadata but the interoperability of these materials (how easy it is to modify, integrate or extend them) strongly depends on the format they are uploaded in.  In turn, also the FAIR principles are differently applicable to the four phases, e.g. training materials being findable in the development phase implies being findable by other potential trainers interested in contributing to the development, while in the sharing phase implies being findable to other potential trainers interested in consulting them after completion, for reuse. </p> <p>Potentially, one could compile a three dimensional table to discuss this topic, where the dimensions are: the training platforms, the four letters of FAIR, and the four phases of a project development. In the cells, one could add considerations about if the two dimensions are one fit to the other, and why. The table, decomposed in three two-dimensional tables and pre-filled with the previous examples, could look as follows.  </p> <p>Table 1.1 Phases x Platforms</p> Development Running course Sharing Archiving Google Suite YES, easy collaborative development, automatic backup and versioning NO, no way of searching training materials from others GitHub and GitLab Zenodo Coursera (LMSs) <p>Table 1.2 FAIR x Platforms</p> Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable Google Suite GitHub and GitLab Zenodo YES, rich metadata and search functions NO, if materials are uploaded in non-editable formats Coursera (LMSs) Google Suite <p>Table 1.3 Phases x FAIR</p> Development Running course Sharing Archiving Findable YES, if the aim is to involve other trainers in the development process YES, to allow other potential trainers to reuse the materials or students to access them after the course Accessible Interoperable Reusable <p>Exercise</p> <p>Fill (alone or in groups) table 1.3, \u201cPhases x FAIR\u201d. </p> <p>In the discussion above, you might be more interested in considering a specific phase (because, for example, that\u2019s the phase where your course is in) or a particular letter of FAIR (because, for example, you have been asked by your institution to improve that aspect of your training materials). You aim to understand which platforms would better comply with either one or the other, so focus on specific row(s) of the other two tables. There is not one solution that works for all cases. FAIRification is a process that starts from your priorities and implies adopting increasingly better practices to achieve them and enhance the quality of your training materials. </p> <p>Exercise</p> <p>Highlight the columns in tables 1.2 \u201cPhases x Platforms\u201d and 1.3 \u201cFAIR x Platforms\u201d that you consider more relevant for your specific case. Fill each column consulting all the platforms, especially those that you never used. </p> <p>Exercise</p> <p>By looking at the tables you filled in the previous learning activity, choose one platform (or more, for different phases).

When we want to communicate with other people, we use words, either orally or written and thanks to the common knowledge of the used language, e.g., English, we can understand each other. A sentence like \u2018the title of this chapter is \u201cUsing metadata to describe training materials\u201d \u2018 is clear for us, but while free text is enough for humans, machines need more structured data (and metadata) to communicate with each other.

The sentence above would for example look like: thisChapter (subject) - hasTitle (predicate) - \u201cUsing metadata to describe training materials\u201d.

Creating virtual collections of training materials and assigning own PIDs","text":"<p>For CLARIN, a training event usually consists of slides, handouts, a GitHub page, video tutorials, language resources, datasets and/or tools. The slides and handouts are published on the event web page, while the video recordings of the presentations are published on the CLARIN YouTube channel. In addition, the language resources and tools used during the training are stored in the CLARIN national repositories, with a unique identifier assigned by the institution and can be cited.</p> <p>One solution to have a PID assigned to all the materials used during one training event is to create a virtual collection in the CLARIN Virtual Collection Registry. A virtual collection is a coherent set of links of digital objects that can be easily created, accessed and cited with the help of unique identifiers, for example, a DOI. The links can originate from different archives. Here is an example of a virtual collection created for a hands-on tutorial on transcribing interview data</p> <p>Figure 2: Example of a training collection in the CLARIN Virtual Collection Registry that has been assigned a persistent identifier.</p> <p>Figure 3: Example of a BibTeX citation in the CLARIN Virtual Collection Registry.</p> <p>Other practices that the trainers in the CLARIN community have adopted are:</p> <ul> <li>First, depositing the training materials together with the datasets in their CLARIN national data repository.

In this case, the Marketplace does not assign any unique identifiers, but the authors can identify themselves via their ORCID and can suggest a citation format for their collection.</li> </ul> <p>You can do the same by using Zenodo, for example, by publishing and assigning a DOI not only to the entire training collection, but also to each item in the collection, as can be seen in the next example.</p>","tags":["Unique identifier","ID","DOI","ORCID","PMID","Persistent identifier","Findability","Reusability"]},{"location":"chapters/chapter_05/#3-sparate-dois-for-mix-and-matching-in-a-community","title":"3.

To help, ask yourself the following:</p> <ul> <li>Do you want to get a PID for each training material?</li> <li>Do you want to get one PID for your whole training or course?</li> <li>Do you want to get a separate PID for each topic/module? For example, for a course containing several topics.</li> <li>Do you want to create a collection of topics with a PID where each concept will also have a PID and associated metadata?</li> <li>Do you want to get one PID for your whole training or course?</li> </ul> <p>All questions are valid, you just need to make sure that when you share the materials, all related data will be findable, accessible and reusable as much as possible. With that in mind, you might want to find a strategy to help others reuse your training materials if they are very extensive. For example, a full day\u2019s or a full week\u2019s training event may consist not only of presentations, but also a description of each session, activities, videos, etc. So in this case, it could be handy to split the training into smaller sessions with individual PIDs, which can then be packaged into a collection.</p> <p>By far the easiest way to get a PID for your training materials is by sharing them in a public repository that assigns a PID on your behalf. You can learn more about this in RDMkit and Chapter 2 and Chapter 3.</p> <p>For example, in the case study you read earlier, the Australian BioCommons shared materials via Zenodo, which automatically assigns a DOI to the materials. Similarly, the CLARIN Virtual Collection Registry assigns a PID (either Handle or DOI) to materials added to a virtual collection. If you are sharing your materials via GitHub, you also have the option of using Zenodo to archive your repository on GitHub and issue a DOI for the archive. </p> <p>However, if you are maintaining your own repository of training materials, you will need to have a system in place for assigning and maintaining persistent identifiers.

They allow you to put your work out publicly, while providing guidance to users about how they can use your materials and whether there are any restrictions. </p> <p>Licensing your materials implies that you own the intellectual property rights over them, and you will keep these rights through the licence. You can assign or transfer those rights to someone else (in particular, you should be aware of what the terms set by your institution are), but this is not done through licensing. In other terms, licensing allows the creators and detainer of Intellectual Property the right to profit from their work (in a broad sense) by controlling who uses their creations and how they use them. </p> <p>As discussed a few times now in previous chapters, making your training materials public, others can benefit from your work and experience. It also benefits you as it increases the possibility of your materials being used in the way you would like and in a way that provides you with credit for your work. By attaching a licence to your materials, you get to keep  control over how they can be used. For example, you may be happy for anyone to use your materials, provided you are credited, or perhaps you would like to allow anyone to use the materials, but only if they make no changes to them. Selecting the right licence allows you to make these choices and communicate them to your users.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to remember that not having a licence assigned does not mean that anyone is allowed to do anything with the material, but instead creates confusion around what is allowed.</p>","tags":["Licensing","Reusability","Accessibility"]},{"location":"chapters/chapter_08/#licence-schemes","title":"Licence schemes","text":"<p>There are many different licensing schemes available, each with different types of licences that allow you to choose what users of your materials can do with them. The different schemes were designed for different purposes (often, the type of items that the licence is applied to) and order of restrictiveness. </p> <p>Given the purpose of this handbook, this chapter will focus on licences that grant the possibility to use, modify or distribute the licenced items, the Open Source licences. Licences can also be used to deny these rights, but this choice would not be in line with FAIRification standards. The majority of the popular Open Source licences have been developed for software and code. Among them, the GNU General Public Licence, Mozilla Public License (MPL), Apache Licence and MIT Licence. </p> <p>One of the main distinctions is copyleft versus permissive licences. A Copyleft licence implies that the items derived from the original, licenced item inherit its licence terms. A permissive licence instead provides more freedom for the modification of the original terms. </p> <ul> <li>The GNU General Public License (GPL) is the most restrictive among the licences here described. It preserves copyright terms and implies that any item deriving for the licensed item use must preserve the same GPL licence.</li> <li>The Mozilla Public License (MPL) is also a Copyleft licence, but allows modification and use of the original item in closed-source and proprietary items (software), as long as the MPL licensed items are kept in separate files and distributed with the derived items. </li> <li>The Apache License requires licence notifications and copyrights on the distributed items. However, derivative works, larger projects, or modifications are allowed to carry different licensing terms when distributed and are not required to provide source code. Hence, it is a permissive licence. </li> <li>The MIT License is also a permissive licence, and among those described is the one written in simplest terms. It allows modification, re-use, etc. of the licensed item as long as the original copyright and licence notice is retained in any copy of the source.<sup>1</sup></li> </ul> <p>Each of these licence schema includes many variations. All of the examples above are licences that were originally developed for code and software, so some aspects of them might be sub-optimal for training materials. The most common type of licence used for training materials is instead Creative Commons (CC) and we\u2019ll discuss this further later on in this chapter. Creative Commons was developed to address the issues of sharing original, creative work in the digital world, considering the vast and easy sharing capabilities made possible by current technology. While software-specific licences are focused on the usage of the item as a component of a larger or deriving project, as code often is, CC licences are focused on retaining the Intellectual Property Rights yet allowing the sharing of the items, hence supporting a wider distribution of the intellectual output. For this reason, CC licences are the most used on training materials. However, while this choice simplifies the protection of the creative/intellectual work put into training materials development, it makesthe means for (re-)use of parts of it less straightforward (e.g. single slides). CC licences still retain a wide variation of terms, including some types which are more similar to the Copyleft and others which are more similar to the permissive licences. </p> <p>Your choice of scheme and licence will depend on a number of factors, such as the type of materials, who the materials are targeted at, what you anticipate users wanting your materials for, any rules your institute may have already, and any materials you include within yours. </p> <p>Learning activity: find some examples of licences on training materials</p> <p>This learning activity will help you think more critically about how licences can be used.</p> <ol> <li>Find three examples of training materials that include a licence</li> <li>Do they all use the same licence scheme or type of licence? </li> <li>Are you clear on how you can use the materials or do you require more information?</li> <li>Were the licences easy to spot?</li> </ol>","tags":["Licensing","Reusability","Accessibility"]},{"location":"chapters/chapter_08/#creative-commons-licences","title":"Creative Commons licences","text":"<p>There are four conditions which can be applied to your materials by Creative Commons licences <sup>2</sup>:</p> Image from https://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/6/6d/6licenses-flat.pdf.

Acknowledging contributions serves as a motivation for people to provide input and will drive the formation of a community of interest.</p> <p>A first step in encouraging contributions would be creating a warm environment for people that are interested to work on your material. You can do that by encouraging people you that might be interested, but also online, by writing encouragements associated with your material, and provide instructions on how to contribute.

It should become best practice to use such a matrix also for training materials.</p> <p>The CRediT matrix can be helpful in evaluating whether a person is an author or contributor.
