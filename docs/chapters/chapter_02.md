# How to structure your materials   to facilitate FAIRness?

## 2.1 Long description
 * What are interoperable formats?

 * Examples of different file formats and what makes them interoperable

 * How will you ensure reproducibility / reusability of your materials by yourself and others?

 * Give a clear structure of your repository with folders and subfolders with a sounding (for you and others) 
 Naming files, name conventions


 * README file (GitHub) / Master Doc (GDrive): a document describing and linking all different small pieces of materials in a certain order
Guidelines / recipe on how to re-use your materials (chapter 7?)

 * Annotating your materials  with an extensive narrative so that they can be used as stand-alone materials

 * Assign basic metadata (author, topic, target audience of the material) to allow the re-user  a basic understanding of the context (might overlap with chapter 5?)  - Briefly explain metadata and refer to chap. 5

 * What if your materials are a single document (single slide deck / single tutorial / etc.)

 * How can others contribute - provide examples.
